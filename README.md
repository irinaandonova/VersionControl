I did a commit from Melissa's version, changing the text written in the console and then I staged, commited and push it the the main repository. After that I changed the message written in the console in John's version, which resulted in a conflict when trying to push his version to the main repository. I resolved the conflict in Visual Studio by merging the changes and I pushed the merged verson from John's side. I stashed some config changes in Melissa's version and I pulled the main version. I also created gitignore file in both Melissa and John's version. I created a new branch, where I created a new class. I merged it to the main branch and deleted it. Since I had some trouble merging the branches I deleted duplicate index files.
